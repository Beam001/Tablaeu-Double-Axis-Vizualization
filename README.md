# Tablaeu-Double-Axis-Vizualization
# This visualization was done in Tableau
# I had a data set showing the targets and actual sales of three departments of the same company.
# Names of the departments are; Furniture, Office Supplies and Technologies.
# There were couple of cleanings, sorting and general modeling that was done prior to the visualization.
# Visualization combined three bar charts and dual axis for the three departments 
# The budget is the grey background area chart while the bar charts represents the actual sales.
# Office Supplies budgeting style seems more realistic and efficient. It was done quarterly, taking into cognizanse each of the quarter's complexities.
# This was fun. Thanks to Kyrill my tutor.
